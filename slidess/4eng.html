One of the main virtues of this view is its scope. The same laws that govern the movement of the planets, govern the movment of the simple board marker. There are no special rules, some for the sublunar, some for the supralunar.

Part of what makes this physics philosophically interesting is that it defies our ordinary understanding of matter and thus has received a huge amount of attention in the media.     

</section>    
   
<section>

    Basic idea: if the laws of physics always remain the same and the speed of light is constant, then space and time for two observers at different speeds is different. 
    
    <br>
    (This is even weirder when acceleration and gravity come into play, but let's keep setting those issues aside.)

</section>
    
    
<section>
    The idea that time and space are not the same regardless of frame of reference is deeply counterintuitive. Our intuition tends to favour the view that time and space are absolute.

</section>    
    
<section>
    Special relativity (1905) was first proposed by Einstein and needs no special maths; general relativity (1915) requires a way of dealing with acceleration and gravity and accordingly requires a stronger mathematical apparatus.

    One of the main consequences of general relativity is that we can see gravity as a result of the existence of mass in space-time.

The idea of space-time can be intuitively understood as a two dimensional plane where gravity can be seen as the result of distortions in it.

    Subatomic partices, on some occasions, behave like waves and, on other occasions, behave like particles.

<section><h1>Mathematical model</h1>
    In order to account for the fact, a mathematical model of probability and waves is needed. The <b>wave function</b> is a representacion of the position, momentum or spin of a given particle. (In general, every meassurement in the system is given through a wave function.) Predictions in the system are the result of mathematical operations on wave functions.

<section><h1>Intepretation</h1>
    The experimental results (facts) and the models (maths) do not however favour a specific interpretation. Many options are possible </section>
    
        <section>

    
<h3>Copenhague interpretation</h3>
            A particles does not have a definite state before meassurement. When observed, the wave function collapses.
            
            
            
            
<p class="fragment">Wave function collapse: several Eigenstates possible reduce to one, ie, the observed one</p>

<section>
    
<h3>Realist interpretation </h3>
    
<p class="">Quantum theory is an incomplete theory. Einstein Podolsky Rosen (but more P than E and R): 
    
    The wave function is incomplete: the reason why the values for a given property are not known is that information is missing. There are unknown hidden variables 
    </p>

	<p class="fragment">
    Bell's theorem: hidden variables are inconsistent with the results predicted by the theory    </p>

Completeness: if a certain physical property in fact holds for one partide at a given time, then the state function for the combined system at that time should yield probability one for finding that the property does hold.

    Philosophy of science is as usefull to scientists as ornithology is to birds.<br> —Richard Feynman</blockquote>

    NOA: Our attitude towards science should be like our pre-reflective attitude towards the ordinary world. We accept the existence of objects like tables, chairs, clouds, trees and mountains, although we do not have a precise ways of defining them. They make up our world. NOA suggests: ditto for science. </section>  
    
    <section>
        But science has talked about ether, caloric, atoms, natural tendencies, quarks, spins, electrons, etc. How should we construe the ontological status of such entitites of the past and present science?
